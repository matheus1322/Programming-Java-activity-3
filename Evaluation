What are the strengths of your solution? 

The strengths of my code are the simplicity with which the code was made, making it easy to read, with direct and instructive comments, well-structured with variables, loops, error validation, 
flexibility for the user to choose, input and outputs, the calculation of the total cost of the products well listed after all the purchase entries. 

What are the weaknesses? 

The weak points of my program start with scalability as I had not yet learned about arrays, this limited the program to individual variables for each product, making the program more extended, 
the structure is also not flexible making the program only have 4 products, there is also a problem that the program does not allow you to remove items from the cart, and the program depends on the user inputting something 

In what way could it be improved? 

To improve, I could structure the code better and simplify it using array lists, a more diverse list of products and a cart that could delete items and change the quantity of items as well.
